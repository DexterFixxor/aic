# branch so Sphinx can render them. Avoids doing this inside Docker (no

# Supports two branch layouts:
#   - Root-level 'media/' dir: it is moved to docs/sphinx/media/
#   - No media/ dir (files at branch root): branch root is extracted into docs/sphinx/media/
# If the branch also has docs/sphinx/source/_static/assets, that path is overlayed.
